# ETL-Blockchain

ETL-Blockchain is a novel strategy, based on the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process, to1collect data from a blockchain, 
elaborate and make it available for further analysis. In general, ETL processes allows to automate the operation of data selection,
data collection and data conditioning from a data warehouse, and produce output data in the best format for subsequent processing 
or for business. We focus on the Bitcoin blockchain transactions, which we organized in a relational database5to distinguish between 
the input section and the output section of each transaction.
In paticular in this fold there are algoritms specific for blockchain to collect and transform data and to load them in the database.
The scientific paper that explains the pocess is "Applying the ETL process to blockchain data.Prospect and findings".
